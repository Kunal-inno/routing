          Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without
          leaving happier. -Mother Teresa When you reach the end of your rope,

          that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else. -Margaret

          that you plant. -Robert Louis Stevenson The future belongs to those
          who believe in the beauty of their dreams. -Eleanor Roosevelt Tell me
          and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.
          -Benjamin Franklin The best and most beautiful things in the world
          cannot be seen or even touched — they must be felt with the heart.

          see the light. -Aristotle Whoever is happy will make others happy too.
